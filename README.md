Which programming language and version did you pick?
* JavaScript

Why did you pick this programming language?
* I picked this language because I see it as one of the most common modern day languages being used in just about every web application nowadays. i wanted to challenge myself by using an implicitly typed language

How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so. 
    object-oriented programming - JavaScript supports object-oriented programming, objects can be created using constructor functions or object literals. 
    </br>
    File Ingestion - by default JavaScript can't directly access the filesystem for security reasons. but in Node.js we can using built-in modules like fs. 
    </br>
    Conditional Statements - JavaScript supports conditional statements like if, else if, and else.
    </br>
    assignment statements - You can use the = operator for assignment.
    </br>
    Loops - There is support for various types of loops including for, while, and do-while loops.
    </br>
    Subprograms - JavaScript supports functions, which can be defined using the function keyword or as arrow functions.
    </br>
    Unit Testing - JavaScript supports unit testing through various testing frameworks such as Jest.
    </br>
    Exception Handling - There is support for exception handling using try, catch, and finally blocks. You can throw errors with throw and catch them with catch.
    </br>

List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.
    fs - File System enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions.
    parse - is a parser converting CSV text input into arrays or objects
    readline - provides an interface for reading data from a Readable stream one line at a time.
